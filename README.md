Minichain is a small, lightweight blockchain library created by Srinidhi Srujan Murthy, founder at CSX labs. This mini blockchain can be of high use when it comes to using it, learning about it and much more. Minichain was built to help people understand blockchain and how they can create their own and modify it for their use. Minichain uses flask apis for users to see what can do.

These are the links to the functions of minichain.


The project comes with basic features like listing the number of blocks, validating every block and additionally mining. Proof of work is used here to generate more blocks and a unique formula is used to calculate the hash value. I personally created this for people to understand blockchain development and how it can be employees for other uses such as: Password storage and intense data storage.


To create this project I used python as main language, flask(API), hash(encryption) and lastly OOP method for it to be imported for use. The project was made lightweight so that it was easier to understand and can be easily modified.

Minichain is open source as a project/product of CSX Labs and when people use it it can benefit the projects they are developing. It is the mest way to encript data or critical information.
